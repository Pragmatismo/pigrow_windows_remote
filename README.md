# pigrow_windows_remote

This is the executable version of pigrow_remote.py for running on windows machines, this is the first version so there may be some bugs if you find any please tell me about them. 
  
Simply unzip the folder onto your harddisk and then run pigrow_remote.exe and follow the onscreen instructions to connecet to your pi.
  
  NOTE - when pressing the install pigrow button to set up a pigrow it will take a very long time and look like nothing is happening, be patient and it'll finish eventually... it'll be updated with progreess bars soon, at the moment it's just running install.py found in the pigrow/scripts/setup folder, if it fails then try running this manually on the pi via the command line. 
  
  This is a very basic tool at this stage but expect lots of more useful and interesting features to appear soon...

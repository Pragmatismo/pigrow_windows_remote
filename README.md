# pigrow_windows_remote

This is the executable version of pigrow_remote.py for running on windows machines, it's currently in the testing and development stage so some features may not be working perfectly yet. 
  
The second beta fixes the refusing to exit bug and has a test fix for using background images under controlls, i'll do some more testing and hopefully a clean full version will be available soon.
